Biashara Boss

Biashara Boss is a lightweight, mobile-friendly web application designed to help small business owners in Kenya track their daily work and instantly see whether they made a profit or loss.

From kiosks and mitumba sellers to salon operators and boda boda riders, many entrepreneurs still rely on notebooks or mental math. Biashara Boss simplifies this process by providing an easy-to-use dashboard to record stock, sales, purchases, and expenses — while automatically calculating daily profit or loss.
